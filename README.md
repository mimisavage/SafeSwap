# Web Marketplace with Escrow Contracts on Stellar

Welcome to the **Web Marketplace with Escrow Contracts**, a decentralized platform for buying and selling products with escrowed payments. Powered by Stellar and integrated with the **Trustless Work API**, this marketplace offers a secure and trustless environment for transactions across various product categories.

   - The Trustless Work API is used to manage contract interactions, initiate transactions, and handle workflow automations for the escrow process.

3. **Product Marketplace**:
   - A user-friendly platform where sellers can list products, and buyers can browse and make purchases.
   - Categories for a wide variety of products, from physical items to digital goods.

        ```

        After updating, recheck the version using npm -v.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/SafeSwap.git
    cd SafeSwap
    ```
    
2. **Install Dependencies**:
    - Install the global dependencies for the monorepo and its workspaces:

    npm install
    ```
    
    This will install all the necessary dependencies for the applications within the `apps/*` subdirectories.

---

### Available Commands

- `npm run dev` - Starts the development server of all applications.
- `npm run build` - Builds the production version of all applications.
- `npm run lint` - Runs the linter configured of all applications.

### Managing Dependencies and Running Specific Applications

### Adding Dependencies

If you need to add a dependency to any of the applications within the monorepo, you must navigate to the respective application directory and then install the dependency from there.
    
### Running Specific Applications

Run individual applications directly from the root directory:

1. **Frontend**:
    
    ```bash
    npm run dev:frontend
    ```
    
2. **backend**:
    
    ```bash
    npm run dev:backend
    ```
    
---

### Applications in the Monorepo

The monorepo contains the following applications:

1. **Frontend (Next.js)**
    - Description: The frontend application built with Next.js, providing the user interface for the project.
    - Path: apps/frontend
2. **Backend (Nest.js)**
    - Description: The backend application built with Nest.js, handling business logic and APIs to interact with the frontend and other services.
    - Path: apps/backend

---

## üìö Documentation

For more details on each of the applications, please refer to the respective README files:

- [Frontend Documentation](apps/frontend/README.md)
- [Backend Documentation](apps/backend/README.md)

### How It Works

1. **Listing a Product**: Sellers can create listings for products. Each listing includes information such as price, description, and images.
2. **Making a Purchase**: Buyers can select a product and initiate a purchase. Funds are transferred to an escrow account on the Stellar blockchain.
3. **Escrow Release**: Upon completion of the agreed-upon conditions, the Trustless Work API triggers the release of funds to the seller‚Äôs Stellar account.
